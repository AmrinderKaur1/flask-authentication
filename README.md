# flask-authentication
Authentication project, can be attached with several other websites.
Contains a py file with all the flask code and login, register, log out and almost all of the authentication code that a website needs. The authentication is secured by werkzeug.security module. 
When a user is successfully authenticated, for the sake of doing something, i added a python cheat-sheet file to download.
